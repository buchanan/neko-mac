# Original README

> A Mac OS X port of the [Neko program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neko_%28computer_program%29) written in Objective-C. You can run Oneko
> on Mac OS X but the cat doesn't appear in front of Mac OS applications, so I
> ported it to Cocoa. My version does not change the mouse cursor or support
> different themes. This is based off the public domain Oneko code.

> This program does not show up in the dock. To close it, you either need to open
> the terminal and type `killall Neko` or open the Activity Monitor and quit
> Neko.
